# Gradient regularization improves performance of discrimi-native models [100 marks]
Imagine you’re teaching a neural network to recognize different objects in images. Sometimes, this
network gets too focused on the details of each picture and doesn’t see the big picture. Gradient
regularization helps keep it on track by making sure the changes it makes to its guesses aren’t too
extreme. This paper shows that when we use this technique, especially with small amounts of training
data, our neural networks get better at recognizing things accurately. We call the specific type of
regularization we’re using here ”Jacobian-based regularizers,” and they help us make sure our networks
learn in a smart and efficient way.
To solve this question, it is recommended that you thouroghly read the research paper GRADIENT
REGULARIZATION IMPROVES ACCURACY OF DISCIMINATIVE MODELS . Like the previous
question, you are supposed to create a report and implement different sections of the research paper.
The group shall be based on a different strategy this time. If the second last digit of your roll number
is even, then your group is 1, otherwise it is 2. For example, 12041650 would belong to group 2 as 5,
the second last digit is an odd number.
The following tasks are expected from each of the groups -
• Group 1 : Implement and reproduce the experiments performed in sections C1, C3, and C5
• Group 2 : Implement and reproduce the experiments performed in sections C2, C4, and C6
